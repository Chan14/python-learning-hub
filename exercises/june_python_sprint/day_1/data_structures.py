# Day 2 Challenge â€” List Magic ðŸŽ©âœ¨
# Write a function chanchal_gather_fruits that:
# Takes a list of fruit names (strings).
# Adds your favorite fruit(s) to that list.
# Removes any fruit named "banana" (because maybe youâ€™re allergic or just donâ€™t vibe
# with it).
# Returns a sorted list of fruits (alphabetically).
# BONUS: Print the count of fruits before and after the changes, in a fun way.
# Rules:
# Donâ€™t mutate the original list directly â€” return a new list.
# Use list comprehension somewhere.
# Feel free to spice it with emojis or your unique flair in print statements.
# When youâ€™re ready, drop your function and sample call with output.
# And remember â€” no peeking, no copy-paste, I want that Chanchal-brand creativity
# shining through! ðŸ’¡ðŸ”¥

# Create a function chanchal_fruit_inventory that:
# Takes a list of fruits (could have duplicates).
# Returns a dictionary mapping each fruit name to how many times it appears in the list.
# Bonus: Print the fruit that appears the most with a fun message.
