💪 Python Practice Gauntlet — Data Structures Edition
🔁 Round 1: List + Dict Drills (Warm-Up)
Find the second largest number in a list.

Flatten a 2D list like [[1,2], [3,4], [5]] to [1,2,3,4,5].

Reverse the keys and values in a dictionary.

🔥 Round 2: defaultdict + Counter Combos
Count the frequency of each character in a string ignoring case and non-alpha chars.

Input: "Hello, World!" → Output: {'h':1, 'e':1, 'l':3, 'o':2, 'w':1, 'r':1, 'd':1}

Group strings in a list by their last character.

Input: ['bat', 'cat', 'rat', 'mat', 'map', 'cap']

Output: {'t': ['bat', 'cat', 'rat', 'mat'], 'p': ['map', 'cap']}

🧠 Round 3: Thought Challenge
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and groups them into "even" and "odd" buckets using defaultdict.

🌊 Round 4: Set Practice (Real Muscle Builder)
Find all unique characters used in a list of strings.

Find the common elements in two lists.

Write a function to return elements that appear only once in a list.

🧱 Round 5: Tuples + Sorting
Given a list of (name, score) tuples, return the top 3 scorers.

Sort a list of (word, count) tuples by count descending, then alphabetically.
